Just last week Canon introduced the new EOS 550D (Rebel T2i) and this camera will soon be available. Anyone who &#8211; like myself &#8211; is playing with the idea to upgrade from a previouse three-digit EOS camera to the EOS 550D, will probably also checked out the Canon EOS 7D, which offers similar features but in some areas performs significantly better. The interesting thing about the EOS 7D and EOS 550D are, beside a lot of other outstanding features, the new HDSLR opportunities, ie HD movie recording with a digital SLR camera.

But, there are already 18 months in between the introduction of the EOS 50D, which has a body that is certainly at an equal level to the EOS 7D. This usually speaks for a quick upgrade from Canon&#8217;s site.

This means for me, that I will not immediately buy the new EOS 550D but wait a little for a hopefully soon comming EOS 60D. The 60D will for sure have a price tag positioned between the 550D (about 700 euros) and 7D (about 1,300 euros) and so get probably in the range of about 1,000 euros.

So let&#8217;s wait and see. Meanwhile the [Canon Rumors][1] website can be checked regularly.
