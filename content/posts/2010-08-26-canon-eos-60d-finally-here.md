Canon just posted a press release and added a product walkthrough video as well as a sample video shot with the Canon EOS 60D. The interesting parts: The camera features an 18mp DIGIC IV processor which is capable of 1080p H.264 video. As a new feature for any Canon EOS camera, the 60D will have an articulating 3&#8243; LCD screen. Specially for taking videos this could be a real enhancement. The rest of the features is more or less a mixture of the bigger EOS 7D and the smaller EOS 550D/T2i like the ISO range from 100 to 6.400 (plus H 12.800), in-camera video editing (who needs that?).

The EOS 60D will be available in September for roughly 900 Euro (Body) or 1.100 Euro (including an EF-S 18-135 3.5-5.6 IS lens).

**UPDATE** DPreview did [a small but nice][2] little preview of the EOS 60D. Also Philip Bloom mentioned the new 60D, and yes [he is totally right][3]: We will see, what time brings and the EOS 7D needs a firmeware upgrade immediately.
