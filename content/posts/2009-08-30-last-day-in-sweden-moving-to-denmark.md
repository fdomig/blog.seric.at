I am so sad &#8211; Sweden is such a perfect country for me. It feels like living on the countryside but still be in a big city (Jönköping) with so much party and great people! Especially I will miss the people from the students accommodation Cyclamen.

I will hopefully be back asap!

But I am really looking forward to go to Copenhagen, Denmark tomorrow. Starting with an introduction day tomorrow and a welcome dinner on tuesday.
