title: Symfony Support in NetBeans 6.8 Announced

The [NetBeans][1] Team has [announced][2] to support not just [PHP 5.3][3] which was released earlier last week but also [Symfony][4] in the next release (6.8)!

Because I am not very pleased with the PHP support within [Eclipse PDT][5], I am currently using [VIM][6] for PHP, and specially, Symfony development.

Since [Pierre][7] told me recently that the PHP support for NetBeans is getting better and better, I am really looking forward to the next NetBeans release.
