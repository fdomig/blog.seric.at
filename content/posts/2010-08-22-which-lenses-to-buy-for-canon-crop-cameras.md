Inspired by [Philip Bloom&#8217;s post &#8220;Which&#8230;.lenses to buy?&#8221;][1] (for using a DSLR as a movie camera) and my friend&#8217;s questioning about the same matter, I came to the idea to post this little &#8220;guide&#8221; on which lenses to buy for Canon cameras. I am mostly shooting still images and haven&#8217;t done much with the movie mode so my conclusions and considerations are generally recommendations for shooting still images. Also, I am using a EOS 7D and thus gives me a x1.6 crop factor compared to full-frame cameras like the EOS 5dmkII, therefore I am limiting my thoughts on Canon APS-C cameras like the EOS 7D or EOS 550D/T2i. However, these considerations work for full-frame cameras as well, since most of the lenses I use and recommend are not specially designed for the smaller EF-S mount but for the standard EF mount. Nevertheless, it is necessary to fill the lack of EF wideangle lenses for APS-C cameras with some lenses particulary designed for these type of cameras.

General purpose lenses

The first question for any (new) photographer is, which lens should I buy to fit most of the situations. This is however also dependent on the type of images you are planing to take. Shooting mostly birds and other small animals outdoor is different from shooting mostly architecture and landscape scenes.
