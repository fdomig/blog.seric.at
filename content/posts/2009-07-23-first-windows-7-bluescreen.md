Yes I was interested in the new Windows 7. I yesterday downloaded the Windows 7 Release Candiate, which should be stable enough to try on my Macbook Pro. Economically as I am, I did not want to waste a blank DVD and that was the reason I choose Parallels to install Windows as a virtual machine.

**First time:** Failure during boot, no reaction of the windows system.

**Second time:** Better try, windows crashed after the copy of all Windows specific data with the typically bluescreen (which has not changed since Windows 95).

**Conclusion:** I stay with Mac OS X and Linux.
