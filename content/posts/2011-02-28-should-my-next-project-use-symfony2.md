In a couple of hours, the [Symfony Live][1] event in Paris is going to start. You can expect Fabien Potencier to release Symfony 2.0 at the keynote he is holding on March 3rd at 17:30.<img src="/uploads/2011/02/symfony2-150x80.png" alt="" title="symfony2" width="150" height="80" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-320" />

This is actually not a big deal since Symfony2 has been [around][2] for a couple of months. The big question is, should you already start developing your next project with Symfony2? There is no definite answer to that but what you can expect is a &#8220;not so much&#8221; changing API and already robust Framework right from the start. If you are planing a big project with longer time to develop, Symfony2 is a must. If you have already started and use Symfony1.4, stick with it.
